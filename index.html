	<h3> Goals</h3>
	<p>I eat, breathe, and sleep technology. I'm always learning something new and am ready to pounce on opportunities to lear more at all times. I'm looking to build applications across many sectors, from Finance to Entertainment. I'm especially interested in implementations of blockchain and anything to do with livestreaming and eSports (or any combination of the aforementioned).</p>
